# xskill-gitpod

This is a simple repository for demonstrating how to use Gitpod for SIH use cases:

* training (self-directed, workshops)
* code development and maintenance 

See the [hello-nextflow]() branch for the training environment demo and the [juxtorpus]() branch for the code development and maintenance demo.
