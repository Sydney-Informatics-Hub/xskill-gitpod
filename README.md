# xskill-gitpod

This is a simple repository for demonstrating how to use Gitpod for SIH use cases:

* training (self-directed, workshops)
* code development and maintenance 

See the [hello-nextflow](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/xskill-gitpod/tree/hello-nextflow) branch for the training environment demo.
